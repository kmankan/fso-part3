Fullstack phonebook application for storing, viewing and deleting contacts.

This application uses a React frontend for viewing, adding, filtering and deleting contacts in a phonebook.

The backend server uses expressJS, it holds the contact data and serves the necessary information as the frontend is engaged with. It also logs all HTTP request information to console using the morgan module.

The fullstack app is currently hosted on Render.io: https://the-phonebook-test.onrender.com/
